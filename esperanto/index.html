<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Esperanto was designed to be an international language by L.L Zamenhof. While it has missed the mark by miles, it is the morst spoken conlang; there are native Esperantists and second-generation Esperantists. It is fairly easy to learn, with only 16 grammar rules, although it uses diacritics and has some complex (albiet somewhat common) grammar rules; this has given rise to "Esperantidos", however none of them are as spoken as Esperanto (Ido has the most out of all the Esperantidos).</p>
